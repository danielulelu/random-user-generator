# random-user-generator
This is a simple random user generator which displays random users when the button is clicked.
This is made using Vue framework. 
The onClick attribute makes it easy to switch border and button colors depending on the
gender of the random user generated, thanks to CSS which makes it beautiful.
For men, the border and button colors turn blue while for women, the colors turn pink.
